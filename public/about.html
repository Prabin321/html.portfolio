<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! my name is Prabin uprety, a passionate and determined Computer Science student originally from Nepal, currently studying in the United States. 
  As a junior-level student, I’m focused on learning the fundamentals of software development, problem-solving, and building real-world skills through hands-on experience.'</p>

<p>I’m deeply interested in technology and how it shapes our world — from web development to algorithms and data structures. Although I’m still early in my journey,
   I’m excited to explore opportunities in the tech field where I can grow professionally while contributing meaningfully to a team.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I’m someone who values persistence, learning from mistakes, and stepping outside my comfort zone. Whether I’m coding, collaborating on projects, or volunteering in the community, I bring a thoughtful and curious mindset to everything I do.
   I’m currently looking for internships or entry-level opportunities where I can continue learning, expand my technical skills, and gain experience in a professional setting.</p>
